# Blog Application

## Description

I'm testing this Blog Application to undestand the concept of the localstorage, how localstorage persist the data, even the tab is closed or user refersh the page.

Blog Application is an application where user can add a new blog, edit it, delete it as well as view other blogs and make changes in them.

Application uses LocalStorage, the localStorage object stores data with no expiration date. The data will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be available when the user comes again.

## Stacks Used
- HTML & CSS
- Bootstrap - A CSS Framework
- JavaScript -> LocalStorage
